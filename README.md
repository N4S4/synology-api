# Synology Wrapper

If you find yourself on this page,
most probably you are trying to develop something for your NAS,

this wrapper might come to your help to build your script.

I would like to specify that **I am Not** a programmer as I do it all
for hobby as is my passion and in my **little** free time.

Said this you will find many things can be simplified and I slowly will.

If you wish to help me you are welcome!


## Premise

I've tried this wrapper only with python3 
I do not know if it actually runs with previous versions 

## Prerequisites

Prior to install this wrapper you will need to install requests library.

## Installation

Just go to repository folder and run the setup.py it will install the wrapper for you.
from the command line go to the downloaded folder and run:

```
python3.6 setup.py install
```

or

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/N4S4/synology-api
```


## Basic Usage

```python
from synology_api import filestation, downloadstation

# Initiate the classes DownloadStation & FileStation with (ip_address, port, username, password)
# it will login automatically 

fl = filestation.FileStation('Synology Ip', 'Synology Port', 'Username', 'Password')

fl.get_info()

dwn = downloadstation.DownloadStation('Synology Ip', 'Synology Port', 'Username', 'Password')

dwn.get_info()

```

response would be json data

```json 
{'data': {'enable_list_usergrp': False,
  'hostname': 'MyCloud',
  'is_manager': True,
  'items': [{'gid': 100}, {'gid': 101}],
  'support_file_request': True,
  'support_sharing': True,
  'support_vfs': True,
  'support_virtual': {'enable_iso_mount': True, 'enable_remote_mount': True},
  'support_virtual_protocol': ['cifs', 'nfs', 'iso'],
  'system_codepage': 'enu',
  'uid': 1026},
 'success': True}
```

## Available Functions

#### What's still missing

There is still few missing function which is a work in progress:

| Missing in FileStation |
|----------------------|
| SYNO.FileStation.Thumb  |  

| Missing in DownloadStation |
|---|
| SYNO.DownloadStation.Task create |

| Missing in Virtualization |
|---|
| SYNO.Virtualization.API.Guest create |

### Bugs

Maybe? 

I hate bugs..

well report them please (if you'll ever use this code)

### Conclusions

There is still a lot to implement.

The code is probably is some parts twisted and I will try to optimize it at best
