# Contributing to synology-api
First things first many thanks for contributing!
I know it is not easy to spend free time to contribute to a passion!

The **very** little guidelines written in here would be just the basis on how to contribute to this package.

As I say the following are just _guidelines_ so do not feel obligated, **except for the docs, please _follow_ the docs guidelines :)**

## 📝 Documentation
Documentation is **important**, specially in this end-user focused package, so please take look at the [Documentation Guidelines](contribute/docs_guidelines)

## 😁 Be cool
Take a moment to check out our [Code of Conduct](contribute/conduct_code)

## 🛠️ Testing
You should **test your code** on your Synology NAS (_if you own one_), this would save us plenty of time before merging any of your pull request.  

It does not mean that we will not test it before but makes the process a lot easier and creates less open pull requests which means less hassle and review.

## 🌐 Pull Request
Check if there is an active branch in progress and **always** make sure you are pulling into the right branch.  

Before creating a **PR** make sure to do not change setup, License and any other non code related file.
Changing them would only slow down the process with consequently need of modifying the PR.

## 🫵 We want you
We need volunteers so you may be the **one**!

If you contribute we will become many which means, for me, this package will become even better.
Do not be scared or shy to make a pull request and/or let us how we may improve this wrapper.
